"""The dropWhile Function
https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-dropwhile-function

Yet another staple for the functional programmer. You have a sequence of values
and some predicate for those values. You want to remove the longest prefix of
elements such that the predicate is true for each element. We'll call this the
dropWhile function. It accepts two arguments. The first is the sequence of
values, and the second is the predicate function. The function does not change
the value of the original sequence.

```python
def isEven(num):
  return num % 2 == 0

arr = [2,4,6,8,1,2,5,4,3,2]

dropWhile(arr, isEven) == [1,2,5,4,3,2] # True
```

Your task is to implement the dropWhile function. If you've got a span
function lying around, this is a one-liner! Alternatively, if you have a
takeWhile function on your hands, then combined with the dropWhile function,
you can implement the span function in one line. This is the beauty of
functional programming: there are a whole host of useful functions, many of
which can be implemented in terms of each other.

    return list(dropwhile(pred, arr))
